# TERRA CHIMERA
## GAME RULES
v.0.1 - ALPHA
This is all the notes and brainstorming for the game including ideas that have been tested or abandoned and why.

## STORY
Combination of Pokemon, Terra Mystica where players develop their team through science, magic and cookery with cute mutant monsters,
while exploring and adventuring in a fantasy world and battling to be the terra chimera champion.
 
## OBJECTIVE
Each player builds their own tableau as a team of researchers in science, magic and cookery, discovering, hatching, mutating and training cute mutant monsters.
You take control of lands and send your monsters to battle in the championships for each region and be awarded the most championship trophys.

## BASICS
- 2-4 players
- 60 - 120 mins (no reference)
- setup involves each player taking a lodge board and following the setup on that board, drawing their starting hand and selecting starting aldermen for each district
- play takes place over 6+ seasons
- each season has phases
  - elections - new aldermen are elected for each district
  - income - income is awarded based on the state of your lodge
  - the chase - players take actions round robin until all players have passed
  - the final hour - once a plot is unleashed, a special final phase takes place
- after the final hour, final power is total and the most powerful lodge standing wins

## PARTS & BOARDS

### BOARDS & LOCATIONS

#### City Board
The city board is where real-world action occurs in the game, and represents the the fictional steam-era "London" that is the game's setting.   The city is made up of **five different districts**: *North, East, South, West* and *Central*, and each contains **four borroughs** that in turn contain **seven hexagonal spaces**.   Each district has a space for the currently elected **alderman**.  They set some rules for that district while the remain elected.  Around the outside of the city is the **power track** that keeps track of the overall power of each lodge in the city.  Each lodge has a pawn on the power track (basically "victory points" earned for different actions that increase the lodge's power). In the final hour, the secret societies clash, unleash their secret plots and only one is left standing.

##### How will locations / empty space play into the game? #####
Building near the city center is more expensive, but trading goods for coin is more profitable.    Building near your own places improves your influence - being the dominant lodge in a district gives you victory points.   Building apart allows you to effect more districts.   Building near an opponent allows them easier access to your secrets.   There are also ten (10) unique locations that can be added to the game based on cards that have their own related actions.    Museum, Chapel, Stables, Constable, Tavern, Morgue, Speakeasy, Brothel, Dungeon, Blackmarket.

#### Astral Track?
A circular depiction of each of the astral sigils and their state of favor or disfavor/alignment.
The thee spirits indicate the current astral alignment and they move forward one or more positions per season.
The white, black and red tokens indicate the sigils in favor.
Each lodge can perform rituals to increase their energy in any of the sigils.

[Ideas]
- "Spirit" Tokens or pointers on this represent the current astral signs in favor [Y]
- One of eight signs are either in favor, disfavor or neutral [Maybe]
- They change with each season? [Y]
- Different cards, lodges and secret societies gain extra benefit based on these [Y]
- Occultists can influence these through actions [Y]

#### Lodge / Guild board 
[Idea]
This is an alternative idea where the lodges are seperate from players, and players are conspiracies that are using/manipulating lodges and guilds.  
The actors each player have determine how they can work within each lodge or guild.
This board/track shows the relative favor or disfavor of each lodge, plus number of free workers in each, shows the current head of each lodge,  other resources?

#### Player Board / Lodge Board
This board is where an individual player controls the inner workings of their secret lodge.
The lodge board has several special spaces, and other than the lodge name, everything can be configured about the set-up for each lodge

##### Grand Master
Any actor can be placed as the grand master of your lodge, and their attributes are considered the attributes of your lodge.  The grand master can be protected by toughs or occultists, and can be leveled up in order to gain power and enact the plot.

##### Plot 
This is a pair of cards, played at the beginning of the game and is played face down in front of the player.  One card describes your secret society, their associations (which may be visible), and the other is your plot.  It has specific slots visible on the back that must be filled with resources, but the exact number and type are only known to the player.  These determine some rules for scoring power at the end of the game.  They can be looked at at any time by the player holding them.  They can be revealed by other player's investigators if the secrets pile is empty.

[ALT] The plot is a single card held in your hand and has a high specific cost to play.   The conspiracy card is your secret society behind your lodge and describes some additional scoring that happens based on the secrets you have as well as other elements in your lodge when your final plot is revealed.

##### Power levels
These are sliders or pools on your board or possibly on your secret society card.  Not sure if this may work better like this or as resources.  
Possible powers:  
Influence (behind the scenes), Occult (magic power), Popularity (public support).  These change based on actors in your lodge, your grand master, and elected aldermen
Maybe everything can be expressed as power levels:  Workers, Toughs, Investigators, Occultists?  Or Pawns
##### Insignia
This is the symbol for your lodge / type of pawn you have?  Each has an animal and a color.
##### Vault
This is where the players current resources are stored and can be spent from.  Not sure if this will just be the general supply for the player, or things must be put here specifically to be used in secret plots.  May not be a part of the baord
##### Secrets
This is a face down pile of cards that represent the secrets of the lodge.  In order to play certain cards you may have to add to the secrets pile.  Other players can investigate your secrets to unveil your plot.  These cards can be used to score power and victory in the final hour.  
##### Pawns and Buildings
Each lodge has potential pawns and buildings they can raise under their control.   Once they are in play, they will grant the player power, income or resources, but they will cost resources or workers to put into play.  There is also a cost to keeping a pawn on a building in order to continue to occupy it
	
#### Hand
Your hand of cards.  These can be played during the action phase if you can pay their cost and you have at least one lodge hall per actor in play.

#### Cadre
The actors played face up in front of you.  These are powerful members of your lodge and of society.  They have abilities that can be used by your lodge, and you can also attempt to get them elected as aldermen of a district

### Pieces	

#### Pawns
These are pieces that can be moved around the board, and from the player board onto the city board.  All pawns can be involved in plots and elections.   Each pawn has specific places it can be used in order to cause an effect or use it's special power.
##### Worker
Craftsmen that can be put to work to create resources - Food, Material, Energy which can be traded for Coins
- Place on an open space to earn one food or one material
- Place on a factory space to earn additional resources based on existing workers and actor
##### Tough

- Place on an opponant lodge to prevent additional work that turn
- Place on an opponant space with a worker to return them to the player board
- Place on an actor to attempt to assasinate
- Place on a plot card to enact
##### Investigator
Deft inspectors who can unearth secrets of your opponents.
##### Occultist
Mystics who use occult methods to enact favor for the lodge and their plots.   
##### Peasants 
People on the board that can be hired for any task [ALT] No Peasants
##### [ALT] Generic Pawns
All pawns are the same for a lodge, they just cost differently and act differently based on where they are placed on the board.

#### Resources
These are pieces that are collected from a "bank" and stored in a Lodge vault, or sometimes on board locations or installed into a plot.  They are pieces of plastic, wood or cardboard that represent resources that can be used or spent.  Resources are used to build buildings, trade for coin, hire pawns, recruit actors, gain victory points, and enact your conspiracies plot.
##### Coin
Gained by workers traveling to the market space in the board's center and trading resources.
##### Bread [ALT] Food
Produced on farm spaces by placing a worker on the space.  An additional bread is produced for each worker on the space, and for every actor with a baker trait.
##### Meat
Produced on butcher spaces by placing a worker on the space.  An additional bread is produced for each worker on the space, and for every actor with a butcher trait
##### Ingots
Produced on factory spaces by placing a worker on the space.  An additonal ingot is produced for each worker on the space, and for every actor with a smith trait.
##### Timber
Produced on forrest spaces by placing a worker on the space.  An additional timber is produced for each worker on the space and for every actor with a lumber trait.
##### Ether
Produced on a lyceaum space by placing a worker on the space.  Additional ether is produced for each worker on the space and for every actor with an occult trait.
##### Phlogiston
Produced on a chemist space by placing a worker on the space.  Additional phlogiston is produced for each worker on the space and for every actor with a chemist trait.

#### Cards
The deck of cards represent the cast of potential characters, items and plots points that can become part of your conspiracy.  

The **draw pile** is referred to as the **cast**, your hand the conspiracy, and individual cards as actors, artifacts, locations, gambits, boons or conditions.

This is the main deck of cards that you can draw from
		- **Actors** that enter your conspiracy (32)
		- **Artifacts** that can be added to secrets or played during specific phases, or added to a lodge to be used by any actor (8)
    - **Locations** that can be added to the board and pawns can be played there to activate their benefits

Each actor has one or more associated guilds, astral signs and special powers.  
They also have a base base influence (adds), constitution (toughs to kill) and aura (improvement of astral track). 
Lastly, there is a cost to bring them into play.

The player hand is referred to as your **conspiracy** and you must pay to play them into your **cadre**.

### Places / Buildings

The total number of buildings controlled by the lodge in a district determines the most powerful lodge in the district.  Ties are broken by continously controlled spaces.

#### Marketplace
Resources that you have collected can be sold.  By placing a pawn in the marketplace, you can sell resources for coin at the going rate.

## Brainstorming Notes
Each conspiracy must gather resources, draw actors into their conspiracy and put them into places of power to enact their secret plots.

Questions/Options
Are players un-named conspiracies?  
Are they lodges that are the "front" for a conspiracy?  
The lodge has influence in different guilds, trades, districts, etc?

Idea 
Based on each district and what factories are there, different resources are produced
Then as actions, based on bidding of player actors with levels of influence, they can collect the resources produced in that district OR neighborhood.  Special cards will give other players the ability to swoop in and collect resources, but may make it harder for them to take them in the future

# 20200218 - Initial ideas

Game #idea board game RPG that has session and campain elements with "innocent" npc types, guilds who control their lives, then secret societies (think rosecucians, masons, satansist, enlightened) who work on yet another . everybody has goals - collect timber and trade for food, rough up an occultist, investigate a factory - but also a plot that your secret society is working towards.

- Cards can be added to secrets pile and removed as items.  Remaining cards help cabal
points, so that even mundane players an win, a guild can win, a conspiracy can win OR everybody might die in the balance and everybody loses

six rounds
unlimited turns using engine building
plus drafted cards that have multiple meanings
secret objectives
guild objectives and actions
commerce
magic
plague, famine, invaders
relics

- Tasks are objectives for players.  If they succeed, they improve their standing? 
Or get an item into their secrets deck?   Characters have tasks built in?  Or there is a task?
Draw a task and if you can complete it, you get the reward.  If you can't, you must spend something to keep it or discard with an energy.

- Some things might be sliders rather than pieces?  Like you put a worker on a slaughterhouse and that increases your food store?  Or an occultist on a temple spot and it increases your orgone.

- Plots: if unleashed it becomes the final turn and a grand battle occurs as every player gets one turn to act and resolve their conspiracy.  Only players with plots can take turns in the grant battle

- Use magic, ingots, flesh and wool to build a secret golem or champion for your conspiracy, when activated has vast power and influence and victory points.

- Resources: ingots, wool, gold, phlogiston, aether, bread, glass, brick, timber

- controlling the most areas in a section allows you more influence at the end of the round and ability to vote on aldarman

- Your conspiracy/chars can take one of several actions.  Manage work, move pawns, enter politics, build plot, build factory, rally influence, bolster lodge?

- certain rituals can change the alignment of the planets to create constellations that are helpful for certain lodges or for certain plots

- can claim things from the guild based on your ranking in the guild/lodge?

- The aldarman can come from the candidates OR from your actors.

- the aldarman in power sets goals and rules for the season - they can pick an edict tile that sets a rule in the district? 

- in each season there will be a different market tile showing the exchange rates?  maybe tiles and cards can be the same?

that unlock three sigils of power

each of the secret societies and lodges
have a position of favor on a balance track.  you can take actions that bolster or impune each of these groups, and if you have a public member of these groups, they can spend power to take actions, but it will reduce the overall influence.  also the MOST influential and LEAST influential groups have boons or failures after each round, and are bestowed on any player with  an actor of that type

toadstool

diamond/spade

- revamp:
you are playing a lodge and a conspiracy (secret card)   
- lodge boards have buildings
- lodges build and make goods, and gain members, build cottages
- build a cottage in a certain location
  - each cottage spawns a pawn at the start of the day
- each "pawn" has a goal, but no real other direction?
- schemes - play actors
- day - play pawns and actions

**Resource types**
Pawns - represent small people and can be placed on the lodge board, city board or actor cards
Coin - represents wealth
energy
material
occult
artifact
food

Lodge (your mat?), Guild (on board location?), Mill (on board production?), Cohort (your active characters in play), Conspiracy (your hand?), Astral Signs (sigils that are associated with different guilds and secret societies)

when you spend the influence of a lodge, if you do something positive, it returns to the pool.  if you do something negative or selfish, it is lost / the lodges favor goes down

Two sided building tokens, one for active o e for shut down

Toughs count for two workers

Secret societies: rod of hermes

 - [ ] Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

#### Brainstorming & Early ideas
- Lodges are public societes with affiliates to trades and cabals
- Trades relate to the players and the board
- Cabals are secret organizations of power
- Token types:  resources, workers, occult
- Resources are defined by the location on the board and can be collected by workers, lodges, politicans or other card/actions
- Playing an actors card into your secrets pile allows you to benefit if they come to power, or as a reaction by an opponants investigator
- You play to advance your lodge by bringing actors into your cabal
- At the end of each act/season (6 total) there is an election of aldermen for each district
- Each player has tokens or cards it can use to influence an election or other players votes
- Play deck contains actors and items
- Cabal deck contains cards that match each cabal (oh?)
- Lodge deck contains cards that match each lodge (oh?)
- Trial deck contains tasks that the player can accomplish to then alter the favored signs or recieve another benefit
- Hovels can be place from a collective pool at the cost of two coins
- Your henchmen can be placed for the cost on your playmat, modified by actors or the state of the favors
- At the start of an act, you gain favor based on each alderman, coin or food based on each trade workshop and influence or actions from each actor
- Every card has some sigils on it which can be used to build power for a cabal
- Actor types?
	- Butcher +2 food
	- Baker +1 food +1 home
	- Candlestick mater +1 candle
	- Investigator +1 move
	- Weaver +1 draw
	- Mason +1 home
	- Tough, laborer, investigator, occultist
	- Hovel, industry, lodge
- Colors match cabal card and pieces
- Accrue influence by building or moving into new areas, cards and actions,  Spending influence can change elections and standing of lodge
- Lodge can spend their standing for various cards like taxation, raids, and assasinations
- Cards put into play, either items or people can be brought into your cabal and based on what people buy, you may deduce their conspiracy
- Cubes for differente types of workers
- There's an occult phase of each roud where you can use your occult powers to align the planets and sigils to benefit your next turn.  6 planets, 6 sigils
- Game board - circle of sigils.  Along those lines each lodge and player has a position.  Or each season where a governor is elected and dependingo n what lodges and secret socites the governers are part of, that effects your victory points
- Victory points depend on a number of factors.  Within 6 acts you will create the most effective cabal, industry, occult, power, actors and plots can give you points
- Technology / science vs occult vs politics / humanism
- Cards have good son them which give you money, or the goods can be used to pay for things
- Look up mancala mechanic
- Trajan circle mechanic with slots matching occult items with specific requirements.  You are putting actions into those to get them
- Politicans set demand?  Or the people set demands, and each player can win favor by producing what is in demand (a setting for each card that is revealed each round
- Two types of story cards - plots and rituals.  Plots require an end of act state, rituals require a sacrifice
- Political parties?  Can be come members or create new ones.  If somebody is winning and they join another's party, they can win overall by boosting their candidate into the lead or assasinating the other candidate
- Form of government is another layer?  Monarchy, Duarchy, Trinarchy, Council, District Republic
- Secrets can be gathered and used to bribe aldermen or power your plot, or unfurl another players plot
- Actors have lodge, cabal and astral signs that effect their power
They may also both have a specific ability, a physical and astral strength, and a cost?
Each lodge has things they can build with resources.
As they build new things, they get something in return, but building more has a cost?
Comments:
Geoff Maddock: Candlestick maker +1 candle +1 discard and draw
Geoff Maddock: Discarding one card into the secrets pile costs one influence
