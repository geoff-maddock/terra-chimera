## PARTS & BOARDS

### DICE
Dice are used to add variable randomness to certain parts of the game, and are handled with wet erase dice created with different face sets
In most cases, the standard die is rolled.  In a negative situation the disfavor die is rolled, in a favorable situation, the favor die is rolled.
**Faces - Type - Color**
000 111 - Disfavor - Red
011 112 - Standard - Blue
001 122 - Neutral - Black
111 222 - Favor - Green
[ALT] 011 222 - Favor - Green
000123 - Gambit - Purple

### BOARDS & LOCATIONS

#### City Board
The city board is where real-world action occurs in the game, and represents the the fictional steam-era "London" that is the game's setting.   The city is made up of **five different districts**: *North, East, South, West* and *Central*, and each contains **four borroughs** that in turn contain **seven hexagonal spaces**.   Each cardinal district has a space for the currently elected **alderman**.  They set some rules for that district while they remain elected and a new election happens each season.  Around the outside of the city is the **power track** that keeps track of the overall power of each lodge in the city.  Each lodge has a pawn on the power track (basically "victory points" earned for different actions that increase the lodge's power). In the final hour, the secret societies clash, unleash their secret plots and only one is left standing.

##### How will locations / empty space play into the game? #####
Building near the city center is more expensive, but trading goods for coin is more profitable.    Building near your own places improves your influence.  Being the dominant lodge in a district gives you victory points.   Building apart allows you to effect more districts.   Building near an opponent allows them easier access to your secrets.   There are also ten (10) unique locations that can be added to the game based on cards that have their own related actions.    Museum, Chapel, Stables, Constable, Tavern, Morgue, Speakeasy, Brothel, Dungeon, Blackmarket.

#### Astral Track
The astral track is a circular depiction of each of the astral sigils and their state of favor or disfavor/alignment.
The two spirits indicate the current astral alignment and they move forward one or more positions per season.
The white and black tokens indicate the sigils in favor or disfavor.
Each lodge can perform rituals to increase their energy in any of the sigils.
Your lodge's astral signs depend on the grand master as well as any occult favors gained.

[Ideas]
- "Spirit" Tokens or pointers on this represent the current astral signs in favor [Y]
- One of eight signs are either in favor, disfavor or neutral [Maybe]
- They change with each season? [Y]
- Different cards, lodges and secret societies gain extra benefit based on these [Y]
- Occultists can influence these through actions [Y]

#### Guild / Trade Factory boards 
Each guild / trade has it's own board on the play area, as well as factory spaces on the play board.   Play begins with one factory in each district.

Favor
- Initially, each lodge places a token on the zero favor slot.
- Favor determines how well your workers will produce at the particular trade.  
- The favor number determines how many dice you can swap for favor dice during production.
- If a lodge falls into disfavor, any dice they roll during production will be disfavor / they cannot produce in that trade [idea]

They can gain favor by:
- Playing an actor with the specified trade (if they are removed, you lose the favor)
- Building a new factory location by paying the git s on the guild board
- Use the special ability of a card

Placing  Workers
- Players can place their workers in the factory to earn resources, which are earned in the production phase.
- If you have no favor with the guild, you cannot place any workers into that trade.
- For each worker placed in the factory, one die is rolled, plus one per favor, and the player collects that many of the specified resource


#### Player Board / Lodge Board
This board is where an individual player controls the inner workings of their secret lodge.
The lodge board is divided into a few sections designated for different functions.

On the left is the lodge name, below that the grand master of the lodge is placed, and below
that is the tracker that indicates his ranking in the secret society.  

In the center are the lodge resources and storehouse.   There are tracks for how many buildings the lodge has placed, how many pawns they have available,
and what resources they have available, each which are indicated by tracking pawns.

On the right is the secrets deck.  These are cards that represent secrets about different lodges and actors in the game and can be used as leverage.
You can gain them through investigations and occult activities and they are useful for gaining power and unleashing plots.

There are symbols and notes throughout that will help in indicating how each section can be activated.


##### Grand Master
Any actor can be placed as the grand master of your lodge, and their attributes are considered the attributes of your lodge.  The grand master can be protected by toughs or occultists, and can be leveled up in order to gain power and enact the plot.

##### Plot 
This is a pair of cards, played at the beginning of the game and is played face down in front of the player.  One card describes your secret society, their associations (which may be visible), and the other is your plot.  It has specific slots visible on the back that must be filled with resources, but the exact number and type are only known to the player.  These determine some rules for scoring power at the end of the game.  They can be looked at at any time by the player holding them.  They can be revealed by other player's investigators if the secrets pile is empty.

[ALT] The plot is a single card held in your hand and has a high specific cost to play.   The conspiracy card is your secret society behind your lodge and describes some additional scoring that happens based on the secrets you have as well as other elements in your lodge when your final plot is revealed.

##### Secret Society Rank
This is the level within the secret society that your grand master has attained.  It can be increased by paying the cost.  [1 influence or 2 coins and one energy]
All secret plots require a certain rank.  The higher your rank, the more immune to investigation and assasination your grant master will be.  Each rank is an additional save.
##### Insignia
This is the symbol for your lodge.  Each has an animal and a color.
##### Vault
This is where the players current resources are stored and can be spent from, a location in front of their play area.
##### Secrets
This is a face down pile of cards that represent the secrets of the lodge.  In order to play certain cards you may have to add to the secrets pile.  Other players can investigate your secrets to unveil your plot, secret society, and dispatch actors.   Some secrets can be removed from the pile and played.  These cards can be used to score power and victory in the final hour.  
##### Pawns and Buildings
Each lodge has potential pawns and buildings they can raise under their control.   Once they are in play, they will grant the player power, income or resources, but they will cost resources or workers to put into play.  There is also a cost to keeping a pawn on a building in order to continue to occupy it.   
	
#### Hand
Your hand of cards.  These can be played during the action phase if you can pay their cost.

## Brainstorming Notes
Each conspiracy must gather resources, draw actors into their conspiracy and put them into places of power to enact their secret plots.

Questions/Options
Are players un-named conspiracies?  
Are they lodges that are the "front" for a conspiracy?  
The lodge has influence in different guilds, trades, districts, etc?

Idea 
Based on each district and what factories are there, different resources are produced
Then as actions, based on bidding of player actors with levels of influence, they can collect the resources produced in that district OR neighborhood.  Special cards will give other players the ability to swoop in and collect resources, but may make it harder for them to take them in the future

Game #idea board game RPG that has session and campain elements with "innocent" npc types, guilds who control their lives, then secret societies (think rosecucians, masons, satansist, enlightened) who work on yet another . everybody has goals - collect timber and trade for food, rough up an occultist, investigate a factory - but also a plot that your secret society is working towards.

Cards can be added to secrets pile and removed as items.  Remaining cards help cabal
points, so that even mundane players an win, a guild can win, a conspiracy can win OR everybody might die in the balance and everybody loses

six rounds
unlimited turns using engine building
plus drafted cards that have multiple meanings
secret objectives
guild objectives and actions
commerce
magic
plague, famine, invaders
relics

Tasks are objectives for players.  If they succeed, they improve their standing? 
Or get an item into their secrets deck?   Characters have tasks built in?  Or there is a task?
Draw a task and if you can complete it, you get the reward.  If you can't, you must spend something to keep it or discard with an energy.

Plots: if unleashed it becomes the final turn and a grand battle occurs as every player gets one turn to act and resolve their conspiracy.  Only players with plots can take turns in the grant battle

Use magic, ingots, flesh and wool to build a secret golem or champion for your conspiracy, when activated has vast power and influence and victory points.

Resources: ingots, wool, gold, orgone, aether, bread, glass, brick, timber

Your conspiracy/chars can take one of several actions.  Manage work, move pawns, enter politics, build plot, build factory, rally influence, bolster lodge?

certain rituals can change the alignment of the planets to create constellations that are helpful for certain lodges or for certain plots

can claim things from the guild based on your ranking in the guild/lodge?

**Resource types**
Pawns - represent small people and can be placed on the lodge board, city board or actor cards
Coin - represents wealth
energy
material
occult
artifact
food

Lodge (your mat?), Guild (on board location?), Mill (on board production?), Cohort (your active characters in play), Conspiracy (your hand?), Astral Signs (sigils that are associated with different guilds and secret societies)

when you spend the influence of a lodge, if you do something positive, it returns to the pool.  if you do something negative or selfish, it is lost / the lodges favor goes down

Two sided building tokens, one for active o e for shut down

Toughs count for two workers

Secret societies: rod of hermes

 - [ ] Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

#### Brainstorming & Early ideas
- Lodges are public societes with affiliates to trades and cabals
- Trades relate to the players and the board
- Cabals are secret organizations of power
- Token types:  resources, workers, occult
- Resources are defined by the location on the board and can be collected by workers, lodges, politicans or other card/actions
- Playing an actors card into your secrets pile allows you to benefit if they come to power, or as a reaction by an opponants investigator
- You play to advance your lodge by bringing actors into your cabal
- At the end of each act/season (6 total) there is an election of aldermen for each district
- Each player has tokens or cards it can use to influence an election or other players votes
- Play deck contains actors and items
- Cabal deck contains cards that match each cabal (oh?)

- Colors match cabal card and pieces
- Accrue influence by building or moving into new areas, cards and actions,  Spending influence can change elections and standing of lodge
- Lodge can spend their standing for various cards like taxation, raids, and assasinations
- Cards put into play, either items or people can be brought into your cabal and based on what people buy, you may deduce their conspiracy
- Cubes for differente types of workers
- There's an occult phase of each roud where you can use your occult powers to align the planets and sigils to benefit your next turn.  6 planets, 6 sigils
- Game board - circle of sigils.  Along those lines each lodge and player has a position.  Or each season where a governor is elected and dependingo n what lodges and secret socites the governers are part of, that effects your victory points
- Victory points depend on a number of factors.  Within 6 acts you will create the most effective cabal, industry, occult, power, actors and plots can give you points

- Look up mancala mechanic
- Trajan circle mechanic with slots matching occult items with specific requirements.  You are putting actions into those to get them
- Politicans set demand?  Or the people set demands, and each player can win favor by producing what is in demand (a setting for each card that is revealed each round
- Two types of story cards - plots and rituals.  Plots require an end of act state, rituals require a sacrifice
- Political parties?  Can be come members or create new ones.  If somebody is winning and they join another's party, they can win overall by boosting their candidate into the lead or assasinating the other candidate
- Form of government is another layer?  Monarchy, Duarchy, Trinarchy, Council, District Republic
- Secrets can be gathered and used to bribe aldermen or power your plot, or unfurl another players plot
- Actors have lodge, cabal and astral signs that effect their power
They may also both have a specific ability, a physical and astral strength, and a cost?
Each lodge has things they can build with resources.
As they build new things, they get something in return, but building more has a cost?

Geoff Maddock: Candlestick maker +1 candle +1 discard and draw
Geoff Maddock: Discarding one card into the secrets pile costs one influence
